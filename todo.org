- pure_complex_t
  an n-dimensional complex is said to be pure
  if each k cell (k < n) is a face of at least one n-dimensional cell
- by the boundary of a pure n-dimensional cell
  we mean the totality of (n - 1)-cell
  which are incident with an odd number n-cells
- boundary operator
  - the boundary of the boundary of a cell_complex_t should be zero
    even if the cell_complex_t is not a bounfold_t

  - a set of n >= 0 points is affinely independent
    if its affine hull has dimension n âˆ’ 1,
    that is, if every proper subset has a smaller affine hull.
