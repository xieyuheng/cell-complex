- abelian_group_t
  - classification (normalization)
- presentation of groupoid is the same as 2-dim cell-complex
  - by which we can calculate homology group of groupoid
  - my first aim is to
    generalize this algebraic structure for 3-dim cell-complex
  - we also want to study group representation
    i.e. find matrix group iso to given group

  - `.boundary ()`
  - `.as_group ()` -- formalize presentation of group
  - `.as_groupoid ()` -- presentation of groupoid with `homotopical_chain_t`
  - abelianization of `homotopical_chain_t` to get homology theory
    abelianization 时如何获得定向 ?
  - `.glue ()`
    我们所要处理的代数结构中的元素是 homotopical_chain_t
    这在于
    元素是有类型的 (或者说是有边界的)
    我们的代数结构类似於 groupoid 而不是 group
    元素之间的复合不是简单地左右相乘
    而是 沿着边界 glue
    - 我们可以从 presentation of a groupoid 入手
      研究 groupoid 对 homotopical_chain_t 的需要
      也就是说
      1. 放宽对元素联通性的要求
      2. 丰富 compose 为 glue

- pure_complex_t
  an n-dimensional complex is said to be pure
  if each k cell (k < n) is a face of at least one n-dimensional cell
- by the boundary of a pure n-dimensional cell
  we mean the totality of (n - 1)-cell
  which are incident with an odd number n-cells
- boundary operator
  - the boundary of the boundary of a cell_complex_t should be zero
    even if the cell_complex_t is not a bounfold_t

  - a set of n >= 0 points is affinely independent
    if its affine hull has dimension n − 1,
    that is, if every proper subset has a smaller affine hull.
