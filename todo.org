- use vector_t to re-imp hackenbush
- use combinatorial-game to solve the problem of iso
  - iso is hard because total classification is hard
    how about classification of manifold
- learn more about group iso
  - cell-complex iso is generalized group iso
    maybe new ideas
- classification of games
  - the games of logic seem like two-player game
    but they are actually one-player game
    -- like sudoku
* cell-complex
- cell_complex_t.eq ()
- cell_complex_iso_t
  - we can use combinatorial-game to solve this
  - graph_iso_t is a sub-problem of cell_complex_iso_t
  - same cell_complex has many different isomorphic representations
    we can not avoid this
  - when generating the new cell_complex
    - such as vertex_figure_t and product_complex_t
    it does not matter how we specify the dic
  - we need to use cell_complex_iso_t to handle the non unique representation problem

- pure_complex_t
  an n-dimensional complex is said to be pure
  if each k cell (k < n) is a face of at least one n-dimensional cell
- by the boundary of a pure n-dimensional cell
  we mean the totality of (n - 1)-cell
  which are incident with an odd number n-cells
- boundary operator
  - the boundary of the boundary of a cell_complex_t should be zero
    even if the cell_complex_t is not a bounfold_t
