    how about classification of manifold

    maybe new ideas

- polytope
  - a set of n >= 0 points is affinely independent
    if its affine hull has dimension n âˆ’ 1,
    that is, if every proper subset has a smaller affine hull.
* cell-complex
- cell_complex_iso_t check
  - we can use combinatorial-game to solve this
  - graph_iso_t is a sub-problem of cell_complex_iso_t
  - same cell_complex has many different isomorphic representations
    we can not avoid this
  - when generating the new cell_complex
    - such as vertex_figure_t and product_complex_t
    it does not matter how we specify the dic
  - we need to use cell_complex_iso_t to handle the non unique representation problem
- bounfold_check
- manifold_check
  - we do not need total cell_complex_iso_t
  - for 1-dim and 2-dim first
- cell_check
- can we encode cell-complex by graph ?
  - what is "encode something by graph" ?
    with graph label ?

- pure_complex_t
  an n-dimensional complex is said to be pure
  if each k cell (k < n) is a face of at least one n-dimensional cell
- by the boundary of a pure n-dimensional cell
  we mean the totality of (n - 1)-cell
  which are incident with an odd number n-cells
- boundary operator
  - the boundary of the boundary of a cell_complex_t should be zero
    even if the cell_complex_t is not a bounfold_t
