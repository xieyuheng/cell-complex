* mathematical structures is about code reuse

- in our euclidean-space.ts
  `row_canonical_form` and `row_hermite_normal_form`
  are almost the same

- to factor out this sameness, and to reuse code
  we need to use matrix over principal ideal integral ring

- this is the main use of abstract mathematical structures
  it solve the main problem of compute science
  but the shame is that
  no programming languages allow us
  to formalize abstract mathematical structures intuitively

* ironic

- We have to re-implement `row_echelon_form` again for `num.matrix_t`
  because `float` is not precisely a ring.

- We also have to re-implement the core algorithm again for the ring of polynomial,
  because there exist more efficient algorithm than the generic algorithm.

- It is ironic that, after the abstraction,
  to reach useful API, we still have to re-implement the core algorithm.
