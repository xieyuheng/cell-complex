* row v.s. col
- `row_trans`
  - If we view matrix as linear equations,
    `row_trans` does not change solution.
  - If we view matrix as linear map,
    `row_trans` does not change kernel of the map.
  - but `row_trans` can change the col_space
- `col_trans`
  - If we view matrix as col of bases,
    `col_trans` does not change the spanned space of the bases.
  - If we view matrix as linear map,
    `col_trans` does not change the image of the map.
  - `col_trans` can not change the col_space
