## Note about incidence matrix and incidence-tensor

`dic_t` can be viewed as sparse matrix.

The recursive definition of `cell_t` means that, instead of incidence matrix,
we need higher order incidence tensor to describe cell-complex.

For example, for 1-dimensional edges, we can use incidence matrix (like in graph theory),
while for 2-dimensional faces, to represent the incidence relation, we need tensor of order three.
