* Mathematical structures is about code reuse

- To factor out the sameness of `row_canonical_form` between `row_hermite_normal_form`,
  we need to use matrix over euclidean ring

- This is the main use of abstract mathematical structures.
  it solves the main problem of compute science -- code reuse.

  But currently no programming language allow us
  to formalize abstract mathematical structures intuitively.

* Ironic

- We have to re-implement `row_echelon_form` again for `num.matrix_t`
  because `float` is not precisely a ring.

- We also have to re-implement the core algorithm again for the ring of polynomial,
  because there exist more efficient algorithm than the generic algorithm.

- It is ironic that, after the abstraction,
  to reach useful API, we still have to re-implement the core algorithm.
