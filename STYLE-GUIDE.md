# Style Guide

## General rules

- Maximal line length is limited to 66 characters.

## Easy to read Function calls

- Function calls and similar expressions
  are separated from the expression.

## `var`, `let` & `const`

- It is not allowed to use `var`.
- It is ok to use both `let` & `const`.
- It is ok to use `let`, even when one does not intend to change the variable.
  - I did this in examples to make them looks easier for new comers.
